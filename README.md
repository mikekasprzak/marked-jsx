# marked-jsx
Based on the work of Jono Kemball with contributions from the rest of the [Ludum Dare](https://github.com/ludumdare/ludumdare) team, this is a port of [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) by Christopher Jeffrey that outputs JSX instead of HTML.

At the time of this fork, the original project was on a several year hiatus. Maintaining backwards compatibility wasn't a goal. We have fixed, changed, added, and removed things.


At the time of this writing, this implementation assumes that you use [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) (since that's what we use), but it could be adapted to be more general.
